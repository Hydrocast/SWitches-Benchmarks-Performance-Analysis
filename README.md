## Project Overview

**SWITCHES** is a research compiler platform developed at CARL@CUT, focused on improving computational performance through hardware-aware optimizations. During our internship, we worked on **parallelizing and benchmarking LINPACK workloads** to evaluate how the SWITCHES compiler performs in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This project investigates the scalability and efficiency of compiled code on multi-core systems.

## Key Features

- Parallel execution of LINPACK benchmarks on Linux.
- Performance analysis of compiled workloads in HPC environments.
- Evaluation of compiler-driven optimizations for multi-core processors.
- Designed to support benchmarking and ongoing research for hardware-aware software optimizations.

## Current Status

>  Ongoing Project  

- LINPACK benchmarks have been parallelized and executed.  
- Performance metrics and scalability analysis are in progress.  
- Graphs and detailed results will be added once the analysis is complete.
